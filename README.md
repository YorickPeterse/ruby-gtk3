# Ruby GTK3

A C extension that provides a Ruby binding to the GTK3 API.

## Important

Currently the code in this repository is nowhere near alpha quality. There are
some basic working pieces (e.g. creating windows) but other than that there's
not much yet. I'm also pretty sure it will leak in several places. Once I feel
that the code is useful enough I'll update the documentation, check for leaks,
etc.
